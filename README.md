The datasets and R scripts that support the findings of this study are openly available at [here](https://github.com/Otoliths/FishBT). 

Additionally, to overcome the ever‚Äêincreasing publication rate challenging the efficiency of our synthesis, we developed an online database (named [FishBT](https://fish-ecology.shinyapps.io/fishbt), Fish Biogeochemical Tags) providing detailed, integrated biogeochemical data on migratory fish species all around the world. The database is an open, updatable and free platform for data query and visualization tools on migratory fish studies using biogeochemical tags.
